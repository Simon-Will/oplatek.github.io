I used to tweak everything. Vim, Openbox, Xfce, window managers, desktop environments.
Luckily, latest LTS Ubuntu 16.04 (despite many controversial - non-standard decision) comes with sane default GUI and shortcuts.

I take a complete new approach:
- Choose sensible defaults
- Learn the shortcuts - do not over-optimize, soon in year or two you would need to setup it up again.

My current challenge:

[Remember keyboard shortcuts: http://askubuntu.com/questions/28086/what-are-unitys-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts](http://askubuntu.com/questions/28086/what-are-unitys-keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts)

A handy wallpaper from imgur.com helps quite a lot.

I also need to [enable for each monitor a separate workspace](http://askubuntu.com/questions/141752/keyboard-shortcut-to-move-windows-between-monitors) so I can send windows among them.

Life is much simpler now. Finally, some time to write a short blog post.
