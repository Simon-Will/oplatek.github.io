## Content 
- How to recognize bashism?
    - Colours in terminal are not portable but are fun:
    - What does this command do?
        - `curl http://wttr.in/Prague`
        - `wget http://wttr.in/Prague  -O - | tee /tmp/wheather` 
- quick recap - redirection
- presentation **cut**
- **Practice teamwork!**
1. create script *documented_list.sh*
    - at the beginning prepare dummy data
    - on the dummy data illustrate behaviour of `ls` options: `-d, -i, -R, -r, -a, -A, -t`
2. create script *test_inode.sh*
    - create file `/tmp/YOUR_LOGIN/a` using two commands and pipe
    - create symlink to the file in your home directory
    - list inode numbers of the target and symlink file
    - create file `/tmp/YOUR_LOGIN/b`
    - move it to your home directory but list the inode number before and after
    - create file `/tmp/YOUR_LOGIN/c`
    - copy the file to home and list inode again
    - create file `/tmp/YOUR_LOGIN/d`
    - create hardlink in the home directory
    - write a comment describing the output
3. create file and directory with permissions `000, 600, 700, 644, 755` what is the behaviour?
    - what is the corresponding `rwxs` representations?
4. create script forgery_YOURLOGIN.sh
    - Wait for explaining `chown` or read the man page
    - Ask your colleague to log to the same computer in the lab
    - change the owner of the forgery script to user user specified on the first argument
        - use your colleague name
    - write your colleague also  a message that he will be accused of writing malicious scripts
    - At the end ask him to change the owner to you.
5. create a directory `responses_YY-MM-DD-HH-MM/raw_responses` for time stamping, make sure that the command has exit status 0.

## Homework
- (3 points) create backup script `backup.sh`
    - The script takes two arguments: a file or a directory and a target directory
    - target directory may not exists, but it can
    - file or directory from first argument is copied to the target directory
    - change the permissions of the files in the target, so it is readable to everyone
    - change the permissions of the target directory and its subdirectories so everyone is able to browse it but not rename it, write to it, delete files from it
        - nor recursively, but all the directories and files should be "readonly"
    - write the target directory size in MB to stderr
    - demonstrate the usage of the script by backing up all *dotfiles* (files starting with dot) in your home directory to target directory `~/settings_YY-MM-DD`
        - hints:
            - YY-MM-DD is for 16-03-11 for March 11th 2016. Have a look at the date command.
            - **For repeated usage you have to "unlock" the target directory for writing again**
            - For loop may be useful for using the script multiple times
