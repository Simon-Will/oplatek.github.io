- Recap homework
    - `rev` - GNU specific
    - `bc`, `cut -c`
    - `sed 's/(.*)([0-9]*) ([a-zA-Z]*)/\3 \2\1/'`
    - `printf`
    - run commands in batch after you ssh to remote computer e.g. 
        - `ssh login@computer 'your_first_command; your_other | piped_command'`
    - `grep -E` does not use basic regular expressions;-)
        - What are the differences?

- presentation/todos - *diff, comm*, **paste, split**

    - `while, read, if`
    - Write a script which uses a `while` and `read` commands to reading a standard input and inserting a number at the beginning of line together with a double colon.
        - Example input:
{% highlight shell %}
Hi Jack,
how are you?
{% endhighlight %}
        - Example output:
{% highlight shell %}
0001: Hi Jack,
0002: how are you?
{% endhighlight %}
