    - `printf`
    - run commands in batch after you ssh to remote computer e.g. 
        - `ssh login@computer 'your_first_command; your_other | piped_command'`
    - `grep -E` does not use basic regular expressions;-)
        - What are the differences?
- Recap
    - join, tee, tail, pwd, pg, less, more, head, chmod, chown, tr, cut, wc, strings, cat
- presentation/todos - *diff, comm*, **paste, split**
- sed regexp continuation

## Homework

- (1 point) Write a script `nl_4digits.sh` which uses a `while` and `read` commands to reading a standard input and inserting a number at the beginning of line together with a double colon.
{% highlight shell %}
# Example input:
Hi Jack,
how are you?
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight shell %}
# Example output:
0001: Hi Jack,
0002: how are you?
{% endhighlight %}
- (2 point) Write a script `palindrome.sh [argument]` which takes as argument either file name or `-`. 
    - If filename is provided it process lines from file. If `-` is provided it process lines from stdin.
    - For each line it decides whether it is a palindrome. If it is not palindrome it skips the line otherwise it prints the palindrome to standard output.
