## Content 
- Recap homework
    -  sed and order of arguments a `-e` option
    -  `/dev/stdin` 
    - `while read line; do echo $line ; done < my_input_file `
- `comm`, `vimtutor`
- Vim
- `ps` if time

## Homework
- (0 points) - recap Sed
    - Understand [Sed tutorial](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Regular.html)
    - Get inspiration from [sed one-liners](http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt)
- (your skills) - learn Vim basics and write every homework in Vim. Start with `vimtutor` and you may try [vimbook](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/doc/book/vimbook-OPL.pdf)
- (3 points) Write a script `tree.sh [dir_path]` which prints tree like structure of directories under the `dir_path`.
    - if `dir_path` argument is omitted used current working directory
    - if it is called on non existing path or file write a sensible error message and exit with exit code bigger than 0
{% highlight shell %}
# example output
DIR: A 
    a1.txt
    a2.txt 
    DIR: B
        b1.txt 
DIR: C
    c1.txt
    k1.txt
{% endhighlight %}


## Bonus
- (2 point) You have a file `commands.txt` where each line has following format:
    - `Run COMMAND with options "OPTIONS" and arguments "ARGUMENTS"`
    - For example:
{% highlight shell %}
Run ls with options "-al" and arguments "$HOME"
Run pwd with options "" and arguments ""
...
{% endhighlight %}
    - Write a script which will execute the commands **and hadle a nasty formated options and arguments**
        - Such as: `Run ls with options "-al" and arguments "I said: \"this is nasty\""
