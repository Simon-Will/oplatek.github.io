- Recap of processes subshells `{}`
    - `{ rm a || rm b ; } || echo failed subshell`
- basic signalling. See `kill -l` and previous **week 8 for homework**.
- `counter=0; seq 10 | { counter=$(wc -l); echo $counter ; } ; echo parent process counter $counter`
- `ps` for printing resources
    - `ps -a -x -o pid,rss | tail -n +2`
- We look at some common errors
    - http://j2m.cz/~jm/vyuka/unix2016/priklady10.sh
    - http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~vernerova/2016/docs/cviceni08.txt
    - In general try to look also to another lab exercise

## Homework
- **In addition to homework from previous week which was announced this Thursday** 
- (1 point) Implement a script which will run forever if not interrupted via **Ctrl + C**
    - If interrupted it will ask you: `Do you really want to quit? y/N`
    - If only entered is pressed it continues
    - If `y` or `Y` is pressed then it quits
    - If `n` or `N` is pressed then it continues
