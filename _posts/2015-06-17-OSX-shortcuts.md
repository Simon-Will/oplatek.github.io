There are few shortcuts I always forget, and a few I have not even discovered or set up.

- Google Chrome refresh page without cache ``Cmd + Shift + r``
- Page up and page down in large pdfs in Skim ``No idea - todo``
- Open terminal from Finder in current folder ``I tried several guides for OS X 10.10 - bot nothing worked out of the box for me``
