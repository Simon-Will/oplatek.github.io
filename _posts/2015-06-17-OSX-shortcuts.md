There are few shortcuts I always forget, and a few I have not even discovered or set up.

- Google Chrome refresh page without cache ``Cmd + Shift + r``
- Google Chrome go to the top ``Cmd + UP_ARROW``
- Google Chrome go to the bottom ``Cmd + DOWN_ARROW``
- Open terminal from Finder in current folder ``I tried several guides for OS X 10.10 - bot nothing worked out of the box for me``
- ``Ctrl + DOWN_ARROW`` launches *mission control*
- ``Ctrl + LEFT_ARROW`` and ``Ctrl + RIGHT_ARROW`` switch to workspace left and right respectively


Karabiner default extension
---------------------------
I use https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
The defaults adds the following mappings:

- ``fn + RIGHT_ARROW`` emulates ``End`` button
- ``fn + LEFT_ARROW`` emulates ``Home`` button
- ``fn + UP_ARROW`` emulates ``PgUp`` page up button
- ``fn + DOWN_ARROW`` emulates ``PgDn`` page down button
- ``fn + delete`` emulates ``Backspace`` button
- Check my [custom settings](https://bitbucket.org/oplatek/osxgit/src/master/Library/Application%20Support/Karabiner/private.xml?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)

Spectacle shortcuts
-------------------
Spectacle is a window manager which allows you to move window around.
Its functionality varies from:

- moving window to left/right half screen,
- maximizing selected window,
- filling up/down half,
- to moving window to center or left/right third.
