There are few shortcuts I always forget, and a few I have not even discovered/set up.
 - Google Chrome refresh page without cache ``Cmd + Shift + r``
 - Page up and page down in large pdfs in Skim ``No idea - todo``
 - Open terminal from finder in current folder ``I tried several guides for OS X 10.10 - bot nothing worked out of the box for me``
