## Homework
1. (*1 point*) Print numbers 3300, 3301, ..., 3333 from file which has 10000 lines. Prepare the file yourself. Numbers are stored each on single line and each number is located on the row with corresponding number.
2. (*2 points*) 
    - Create directory `test` and empty files `test/1`, `test/2`, .., `test/10`. 
    - Use vi and edit all of the 10 files and to each file insert one of your favourite songs/articles.
    - Change the time of modification for file `test/8` so it is the latest.
    - List files in the `test` directories sorted by time. List just the directory test.
    - Merge the content of all the files in the `test` directory to one file called `all` 

## Bonus
* Write a script which find as many commands and functions which measure time both in shell and in C.
  Present them in three columns *(function name, man section number, one line function synopsis)*
    - One point for one function
    - Find at least one C function
    - Describe how you think about the problem
