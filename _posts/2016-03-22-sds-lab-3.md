## Suggested Content

- Dialogue State Tracking (DST)
- Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for DST 
- TensorFlow and RNN recapitulation needed for homework
- **Suggested topics**
    1) Mean Square Error (MSE) vs CrossEntropy loss funkce
    2) Backpropagation (BP) need to know
    3) Recurrent NN (RNN) - BP Through Time (BPTT) need to know
    4) How to debug Neural Networks
        - Tensorboardu, loss function, early stopping
- ** If you have any questions about using RNN and TensorFlow, please ask them in advance via email. I may need to prepare some data or code to demonstrate the answer.**

## Homework - RNN DST
