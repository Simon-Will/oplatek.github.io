## Suggested Content

- Dialogue State Tracking (DST)
- Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for DST 
- TensorFlow and RNN recapitulation needed for homework
- **Suggested topics**
    1. Mean Square Error (MSE) vs CrossEntropy loss funkce
    2. Backpropagation (BP) need to know
    3. Recurrent NN (RNN) - BP Through Time (BPTT) need to know
    4. How to debug Neural Networks
        - TensorBoard, loss function, early stopping
- **If you have any questions about using RNN and TensorFlow, please ask them in advance via email. I may need to prepare some data or code to demonstrate the answer.**

## Homework - RNN DST 
- Explore [DSTC2 tracking challenge data](http://camdial.org/~mh521/dstc/downloads/dstc2_test.tar.gz)
    - Especially field semantics in `data/*/label.json` which you should use to parse DAI
    - Use dev set of size 200. After extracting the dstc2 data you can create it using `ls data/*/*/label.json | shuf | head -n 200 > dstc2_200_dev_set.txt`
        - If you want to compare against each other, use this [split](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oplatek/sds-lab/master/dst/dstc2_200_dev_set.txt)
