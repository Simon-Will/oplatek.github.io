Abstract: Dialogue interaction provides an extremely challenging and grounded evalu- ation of natural language understanding. Natural language understanding has greatly improved over the last 20 years, but what level of understanding is needed to respond appropriately in dialogue in a particular context? How can natural language genera- tion produce these contextually appropriate responses? How can it scale? Should a conversational assistant have a persona or style? Should it entrain to the user, take the initiative, understand greetings and other phatic acts, and use an explicit model of dialogue structure? What are some near term and some long term solutions towards more natural dialogue interaction?
