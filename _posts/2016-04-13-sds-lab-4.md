## Content
- Fork the project [sds-tracker](https://github.com/oplatek/sds-tracker) from Github

## Homework - RNN DST 
- Report bugs
- Come up with a RNN model encoded as Tensorflow computation graph
    - Implement it in `tracker/GRUmodel.py`
    - Use RNN for encode inputs from each turn `sys_utt + DELIM + user_utt`
    - For each turn predict the slots based on the last state from the RNN
        - This model does in fact more SLU (spoken language understanding) because it does care about history
        - If you have this model working start refactoring the code for using encoding dialogue history with another RNN
