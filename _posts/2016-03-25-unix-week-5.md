## Homework

Write Basic Regular Expressions (BRE) describing following strings:

- A row in `/etc/passwd` file containing in 5th column text, which is formatted as *Name Surname*. It means that 5th column begins with capital letter, is followed by lowercase letters and later space, capital letter again and again lowercase letters.
- A row, which contains (probably) a date formatted like `25.8.1998`. We accept "days" and "month" in in range 0-99. We do no care that there is at maximum 30 days and 12 months.
    - Positive examples which will match the regular expressions:
        - `Ahoj, sejdeme se 5.2.2010 po Unixu. Neslo by to spis 35.5.1900?`
    - Negative examples which won't match the regular expressions:
        - `Budu tam 234.42.2010.`
        - `Babicka prijde na navstevu v patek 4.2.20000. Prijdu 23.356.2011.`
