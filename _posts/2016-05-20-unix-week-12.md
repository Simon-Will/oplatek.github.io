## Bonus == Homework 

### Pick one option for 3 points for homework

- Write a script `junk_finder.sh [-o | -s | -t] [-hbkmg] [dir_path ...]`
- (3 points per one option) The options `[-o | -s | -t]` are mutually exclusive and if none specified `-t` default option is assumed
- The script accepts a list of directory paths and if none is provided the current path is used.
- Option `[-h]` prints a help similar to this homework descriptions but which is formatted as in other standard Unix utilities
- The options `-b, -k, -m, -g` determine a unit with which the script is reporting the file size. The default one is `-b`
    - `-b` - the script reports sizes in bytes
    - `-k` - the script reports in kilobytes
    - `-m` - the script reports sizes in megabytes
    - `-g` - the script reports sizes in gigabytes 
    - report only integers, but document how do you round the numbers
- For option `-t` the scripts computes sizes of all files in directory paths but reports the sizes of files only per file of the files.
    - For finding out the file types it is recommended to use `file --mime-type` command 
    - For example it will report the total number of pdf files, text files, postscript files in the current directory
- For option `-o` print relative path and sizes of files which were not modified at least one month and also belong to 10% of files under examined directories which are the oldest (were modified the longest time ago).
- For option `-s` the script reports the sizes of directories and files in breadth first (top down) manner.
    - It first reports the names and sizes of of top-level directories given as arguments
    - Then it reports sizes and the relative paths to files and directories in the top level directories and so on.
    - Note that this option may be very computational demanding and nontrivial level of caching precomputed information is expected.
