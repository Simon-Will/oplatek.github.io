### What to learn first?
AWS is useful, well documented but overwhelming.
The most important question for me is **What to learn first?**

1. Setup bill alerts
 There is always danger of accidentally spending money.
 By setting up alerts for
  - overstepping budget actual budget plan
  - expected budget plan
 one can be quite safe not to spend a fortune

2. Setup logging
 Just makes logging easier

3. Automation
Install command-line interface (CLI) for reproducibility and learn basic of *CloudFormation* an AWS service to automate things

Especially, it is useful to learn to shut down all your setup easily.

4. Learn other AWS tools based on your needs
However, be sure to take into account security (Role managment and best practices) since there is lot of bots trying to hijack your resources.
