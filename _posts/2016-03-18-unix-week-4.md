## Content 
- Homework discussions - rights
- Recapitulation
    - numeric representation
    - permissions `000, 600, 700, 644, 755` what is the behaviour?
    - Show the names and login times of the currently logged in users
    - Quick recap test - show prikazy.txt
- `env`, standard variables, calling script from anywhere and `PATH` variable
- `mail`: mail me (email on white board) and yourself in carbon copy (cc) your login and your machine name so I can see where you are sitting 
    - use one liner
    - write a pomodoro script which email to stretch every 20 minutes
- `last`, `sort`, `join`, `uniq`, `/ect/passwd # or getent passwd`
- if time, prepare for future:
    - `find` - look at the syntax till next time
        - print is not like printing - 1200 pages cost money
    - recap `less`, `more`, `pg`
    - `sync`


## Homework
Send me both your scripts but also the files `counts_days` and `days_counts`

- (2 points) Count number of logins to machine `u-pl24` per day of week
    - hints:  `last, sort, uniq`
    - Store the results to `counts_days` file in format:
{% highlight shell %}
  243 Mon
  992 Tue
  823 Wed
 1202 Thu
  602 Fri
  123 Sat
   32 Sun
{% endhighlight %}
- (1 point) Swap the columns from `counts_days`
    - Keep the numbers aligned to the right side
    - Store the results to `days_counts` file in format:
{% highlight shell %}
Mon  243
Tue  992
Wed  823
Thu 1202
Fri  602
Sat  123
Sun   32
{% endhighlight %}


## Bonus
- (0 points) Write your homework using vim 
    - Finish `vimtutor` tutorial before starting
- (1 point) Change homework from third week so you backup *dotfiles* and *dotdirectories* and change the directories permissions recursively and files recursively so you cannot change/delete them.
- (1 point) How many users with first name `Jan` can login to Rotunda lab? 
    - Submit the code and write me a number into the email
- (1 point) Similarly to homework count number of logins to `u-pl24` per first name of user
    - Hints:
        - `join` command
        - Do not use `/etc/passwd` but `getent passwd` in Rotunda lab
    - Send me also the output in `first_names.txt` file 
- (2 points) - Draw a histogram for `days_counts` file:
    - Suppose that the first two columns do not exceed 18 characters
    - Distribute 60 '=' characters proportionally according counts 
    - See example of desired output for only three days.
    - Send me also the output in `histogram.txt` file 
    - See example output for data `Mon 1, Tue 40, Wed 80`
{% highlight shell %}
